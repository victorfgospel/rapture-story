# The Rapture: Is Too Late? (My Story)

It was the most solemn of days.

When the once mocked rapture became real.

Houses were locked for days.

Streets were desolate.

I saw it happen with my very two eyes.

November 21st, 2024.

The Rapture is a spiritual event prophesied by Jesus in the Bible where God's people were taken away from this earth and catapulted to heaven via an ascension via God's angels.

## When did the rapture take place?

The Rapture took place verily on November 21st, 2024. It was a remarkable day to be a follower of Christ. The once mocked rapture became real.

Jesus raptured a vast number of people in my area.

## How am I sure the rapture has taken place?

Because I'm a witness.

God instructed I write this article.

Streets upon streets were desolate.

Houses were locked for days.

My family was raptured.

## Who am I?

I'm a boy about 24 years of age. 

I stayed behind to make sure the message of the rapture was spread across to the world.

## What will happen after the rapture?

It is said (prophesied) in the holy Bible that chaos awaits the earth.

God took away his people from this earth to save them from suffering the chaos and destruction that awaits the earth.

## What chaos awaits the earth?

The chaos that awaits the earth can be found written in the Bible in the books of Revelation.

## Who wrote the books of Revelation?

The apostle John wrote the book of Revelation.

Who is the apostle John?

The apostle John is one of the closest disciples of Jesus who was given visions about heaven and the end times.

## Are we in the end times?

Yes we are.

## Can you prove it?

Yes I can and I will do so with Bible passages revealing the signs of the end times.

## Is there any sign of the end times?

There are so many signs of the end times.

From my simple observance of the world and from what the Holy Spirit inspired me to know and revealed to me.

We are indeed in the end times.

The first two Trumpets prophesied in the Christian Bible has already been blown and its prophecies fulfilled.

## What are the prophecies being fulfilled?

**Revelation 8:7 NKJV**

[7] The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.

This happened in 2021.

Where most of the largest forests were scorched by fire including the Amazon forest. This in total equates to about ⅓ of vegetation in the world.

**Revelation 8:8-9 NKJV**

[8] Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. [9] And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

This also happened in 2021. Where a large number of volcanoes became active and erupted. It was also recorded in many parts of the world where seas were turning red and rivers red like blood. This occurred in many places.

A certain occurrence also took place in a certain ocean where a large number of marine life died from the radiating heat and larva from the earth crust. This equates to almost ⅓ of marine life.

The last prophecy is yet to be fulfilled.

This all happened at the dawn of 2021.

## Is there more that I should know?

God marked his elect (his saints) with a seal. If anyone prays the prayer of Jesus' acceptance and forgiveness he will be given a mark.

## What happens if I don't receive the mark?

Terrible things will happen.

The rapture might happen for the second if not for the last time.

You might miss it.

And anyone that misses the rapture is doomed to receive the dreaded mark of the beast (666).

## What is the mark of the beast?

The mark of the beast is a demonic mark designed by Satan to force people into hell with him. He knows his time is up and is doing everything to pull in as much people with him into hell.

It is prophesied, in the last days, people can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast. It is forced down on people's throats.

And anyone one who receives it is doomed for condemnation unless they receive God's mark.

## Who gave John these prophecies?

Jesus Christ.

In what Bible passages can the rapture be found?

The rapture was prophesied by Jesus in Luke 21:25-28, Matthew 24:29-31 and Mark 21:25-28.

## Who is Jesus?

Jesus is the son of God who raptured people on November 21st, 2024. To save people from suffering the chaos that awaits the world from his father—God.

He died on a wooden cross.

## Why did he die?

He sacrificed himself for our sake—for sinners. He took his father's punishment for sin upon himself and died on a wooden cross—though holy and innocent, so his father can look at him remember his great suffering on the cross and that he died for humanity sake and forgive us our sins and accept us into heaven.

Simple explanation. He took the bullet meant for us just like a dear friend would. So through him, we can be saved from enternal punishment through a simple prayer of sincere repentance and forgiveness.

He died so his father can say, if my son can agree to come down to earth, live a poor life and yet forgive his persecutors, why not me.

## What can I do to be part of the rapture?

The rapture has already taken place and might happen again for the second or last time.

No one knows.

To be part of it…

**Say this prayer with me:**

Lord Jesus Christ, I accept that you died on the cross for my sins. Come into my life. I accept you today as my personal Lord and Savior. Forgive me of my wrongdoings. I promise to do your will. Thank you for accepting me. Amen.

## What next?

We are about to enter an uncertain time. Let's keep watch and wait. Do not wish to be here when the chaos prophesied on the earth begins unfolding. All we can do is wait and pray and await the second rapture.

In the time of Noah, people ate and drank and disregarded (even mocked him) Noah's message to enter the Ark before it was too late and God shut its doors and wiped the earth with a flood.

In our time, Jesus is our Noah's ark. Get into him before it's too late.
